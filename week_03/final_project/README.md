## Why interested and how I would use the data 
### Why:  
I found this data from kaggle platform. Since my background is related with communication, I am pretty curious about the current video trending all around the world. I think this somehow can reveal the differentiation about demographic and so on.

### How I (possibly) would use this data: 

1. area map: Comparing some countries, for example, the United States and Canada, we can see the trending more vividly.
2. bar chart: Can see the overall catory trending more directly.
3. pie chart: Directly shows the trending catogories.

### Potential data points:
Single YouTube viewers

## Any concerns  
This dataset might be very large since it include all over the world.

## Any concerns  
Secondary data since I found on Kaggle. But I think this would be fine since they include the primary database.
