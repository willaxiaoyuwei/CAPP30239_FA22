<p>"Hello Class!"</p>
<p>This is Willa Wei. I am a second year MPP student. I was born and raised in China. I graduated from Mizzou J-School, so I have strategic communication and journalism background before Harris. I'm a visual person, so I want to learn more about data visualization and see what I can do in the future. </p>
<p>My policy interest are public health and finance. During my free time I would just listening to R&B music and spend time with my cat.</p>
