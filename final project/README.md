## Create Charts for Final Project
For my final project, I decided to end up with create the way people chose to commute within different states in the United States.

So far, I generated some data from ACS dataset as census data source to help me compare with different states. For me, I think the most direct way to represent the data visually is by using bar charts. Thus, I used different bar charts here to create a basic sense about state-area, state-population and how people choose to commute in 2019.

All data found in ACS but the census dataset is pretty large and messy so I did some data cleaning with the help of Excel and Python in order to get the clean version data that I want.
