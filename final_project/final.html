    <h1>People's Preference to Commute</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="commute.png" alt="from_ruters">
    <p>This photo is from Reuters showing people commute by train in New York City. 
      The reason why I choose this photo, because I see myself here as a data journalist to cover the story. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
    <p> This study examines the pattern of car-driving as a way of people within the United States choose to commute. 
      This project explores how demographic and economic factors affect the way people choose to commute.
      Bsically, this graphic shows different area by state in US.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>My intention for this project is to compare Americans commute choice within different states.
        First of all, I decide to look up the actual area size for each state then we can have a thorough 
        thoughts about how large the states would affect the commute choice.

      <br>
      <p>Besides state actual area, I desided to look up the population data in each states. 
        Similarily, just get a glance for census data in 2019 to start with my project.

  <p>Previous two plots give us a glance about U.S. population in different states.
   Now, I would like to use a choropleth map to address the population density within different
   states.</p>

    <p>This bar chart shows thetransportation way in US in 2019.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>According to the data that we got, apart from the work form home people,
      private carpool and public transportation are the two most frequently options 
      Americans would choose to use as commute ways.

  <h2>U.S. Carpool Rate in 2019</h2>

  <p>Post-cleaning Data from

    ACS</a></p>

  <p>Here, I decided to make another choropleth map to show the carpool rate in 2019 within different states.
    I think the overall rate that we can see here, west coast is more than east coast. Since west coast cities 
    have larger area compared with east coast. Especially, in the tech hubs of San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle, 
    as well as in San Antonio, Houston, and Phoenix.

<h2>
  Process and Challenges
</h2>

<h3>Data Collection and Data Cleaning</h3>

<p>
  I think as a car-using heavy country, it is interesting to explore the way Americans choose to commute, 
  especially among drive-alone, carpooling and public transportation. Knowing people's commute Preference
  within different states could be helpful no matter for building public goods in transportation or environmental
  protection. To get the access for these data, I went to some census dataset, such as The American Community Survey (ACS),
  Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). 
  I used ACS dataset as transportation options, carpool & number of riders) related data as our analysis source. 
  Our census data mainly come from FRED, which allows us to use their API to retrieve population statistics statewide. 
  Besides these two data sources, we decide to use BTS data to get transportation services within the U.S. by different states. However, since BTS did not 
  conclude this data as an actual dataset, we could not actually download it directly from their dataset thus we used web scraping to grab their table.
<br>
<br>
  The biggest challenge for me here, I would say, we all know the census data could be super detailed and messy. At first, cleaning a massive dataset was 
  very time consuming. I used python to pre-cleaning my data to keep something I need.
  Secondly, when I look up the population census data for 2020, I realize 2020 is the year that COVID pandemic started. Because of 
  this reason, the census data for 2020 used a experimental model rather than previous yaers' survey filling. Thus, I ended up 
  choosing 2019's data as my final project data. Plus, because of COVID, there are many Americans start to work from home, which would somehow
  affect my intention for this project.
</p>

<h3>Plot Selection</h3>

<p>
  First of all, I used the three simple bar chart as my start to take viewers to start explore my data about commuting.
  I think from the basic bar chart, viewers can know the actual size and population about each states in the United States.
  Then I think probably it is a good way to show a choropleth map to make it more visually about how people choose to commute in different states.
  I think this could be more directly tell the story that I want to viewer know. But the choropleth map is a little bit challenge for me,
  I was trying to make a series about choropleth map using D3js library, but still stuck on it a little bit. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I choosed two choropleth maps. The first one is using Leaflet so that viewers can use interact function to see each states in the United States' 
  population density. The second choropleth map I choose to show the carpool rate within different states. 
</p>
<h3>Still need to go further</h3>
<p>
  I think my project could be more detailed and expanded into more different years to see the trending. Not only one year estimate,
  but could be 5 years or 10 years maybe we could tell more correctly how Americans' preference to commute changed and what is the next 
  trending. Moreover, if I get a change, I want to explore more demographic factors might be affect people's actual choice.
